            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE House in the first place Ordered a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be drawn, for bringing in the Arrears of the Publick Revenue; the Draught of it did bear, That the Money was to be employed <hi>for Raising Forces for securing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion,</hi> &amp;c. But after much Debate, this was altered, and the words, <hi>For Raising Forces,</hi> left out.</p>
            <p>The House approved the Address and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Nobility and Gentry that had been at <hi>London,</hi> and had there desired the then Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to take upon Him the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Government: A Committee was appointed to draw an Answer to the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Letter: No man moved for an Answer to King <hi>James</hi>'s Letter; only the man that brought it, begg'd a Pass to go to Him in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and offer'd Security not to carry to Him any Letter or Paper from any Person whatsoever.</p>
            <p>A Motion was made, That those who had Refused to Sign the Act, by which the Freedom and Lawfulness of the Meeting was asserred, should be turned out of the House; which were not above Six or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Some Letters being read from several Noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and begging their Assistance, Two Thousand Fire-locks, and Twenty Barrels of Powder, were ordered to be sent them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. Upon this occasion, Four Thousand Muskets, and Two
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101131:2"/>Thousand Fusees, and Six Hundred Barrels of Powder, were ordered to be Bought, and brought Home.</p>
            <p>The House was inform'd, that the Lord Viscount of <hi>Dundee</hi> had had a Conference with the Duke of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> at the <hi>Postern-Gate</hi> of the <hi>Castle,</hi> tho the Convention had forbid all Correspondence with him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Treason, and that the said Lord (who came no more to the Convention) was seen near the Town, and 40 or 50 Horse with him. The Convention immediately ordered him to be Summoned; but he was gone <hi>West,</hi> towards <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> which being the Road to <hi>Stirling,</hi> it's thought his Design may be to Surprize that Castle, which commands the Pass of Communication betwixt the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> Parts of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The Convention ordered a Major with 80 Horse to go after him; and the Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> who is Governor of <hi>Stirling</hi>-Castle, is gone to it by their Order, to Secure it against any Surprize or Attempt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordered,</hi> That all Persons betwixt 16 and 60, be in a Readiness to take Arms, when the Convention shall require it; At the same time, several suspected Officers of the <hi>Militia,</hi> were turned out, and others put in their places; and Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> (excepted out of the Late King <hi>James</hi>'s Indemnity) ordered to Command the <hi>Militia</hi> Horse of his County: It was likewise Ordered, That Eight Hundred Men should be Levied and Armed under the Command of my Lord <hi>Leaven,</hi> who has a Regiment in the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Service: The 800 men were found in two Hours time.</p>
            <p>The House finding that Sir <hi>George Mackenzy,</hi> late Lord Advocate, Five of the Bishops, that came to the Convention, and several others, had withdrawn themselves, all the absent Members were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Summoned.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Gourdon</hi> made beat a <hi>Parley,</hi> and desired once more to Treat; but his Demands are such, as he knows the Convention will not grant: He requiring, That the same Security and Indemnity that was agreed upon for himself, should be extended to about 40 Persons more, that he should name; and that after he had delivered up the Castle, he might have a pass to go to King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to satisfie him with the Reasons of his delivering it up; and giving Security for his Return back.</p>
            <p>Those that seem to agree as to the Manner of Settling the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, differ as to the Time of doing it; Some are of Opinion, that it is to be done immediately, as the best Expedient for preventing Disorders; Others think it better to delay the entring upon that Point for some Days, for several Reasons.</p>
            <p>The House Adjourned to <hi>Thursday</hi> at Ten of the Clock, upon which Day, King <hi>William</hi>'s Letter is to be Answered; and 'tis said, the Lord <hi>John Hamilton</hi> will be Sent up with it.</p>
